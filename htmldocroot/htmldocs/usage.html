<H1>FITS storage web help page</H1>
<P>This is the help page for the FITS storage server web interface. If you arrived here unexpectedly, chances are the
system could not understand the request you were trying to make.</P>

<P>In general, the user interface to this web system <em>is</em> the URL that you type into the address bar on your
browser. These URLs are designed to be logical and easy to construct</P>

<H2>Header Summaries</H2>
<P>This system can provide summary tables of the fits headers of data stored on the system. These are available
under the <a href="/summary">/summary</a>, <a href="/ssummary">/ssummary (short summary)</a> and <a href="/lsummary">/lsummary (long summary)</a> URLs. The short and long forms have fewer and extra details compared to the regular summary. The long form summary contains more instrument details, and is useful for figuring out why a given calibration is or isn't matched well to a given science file.  Some examples are:</P>
<UL>
<LI><a href="/summary">/summary</a> by itself shows the last 1000 files, newest first</LI>
<LI><a href="/summary/20091120">/summary/20091120</a> shows the data from 20091120, in order</LI>
<LI><a href="/summary/today">/summary/today</a> shows the data from today, in order. <a href="/summary/yesterday">yesterday</a> works too</LI>
<LI><a href="/summary/GN-2009B-Q-51">/summary/GN-2009B-Q-51</a> shows all data for program GN-2009B-Q-51</LI>
<LI><a href="/summary/GN-2009B-Q-51/20091123">/summary/GN-2009B-Q-51/20091123</a> or indeed <a href="/summary/20091123/GN-2009B-Q-51">/summary/20091123/GN-2009B-Q-51</a> shows all the data for GN-2009B-Q-51 taken on 20091123</LI>
<LI><a href="/summary/20091120/NIRI">/summary/20091120/NIRI</a> shows all the files for that date using that instrument</LI>
<LI><a href="/summary/20091120/science">/summary/20091120/science</a> shows all the files for that date with the science ObsClass. You can use any ObsClass type, ie dayCal, partnerCal, acq, acqCal, progCal, science...</LI>
<LI><a href="/summary/20091120/OBJECT">/summary/20091120/OBJECT</a> shows all the files for that date with the OBJECT ObsType. You can use any ObsType type, ie FLAT, DARK, ARC, BIAS, OBJECT...</LI>
</UL>

<P> In fact, you can specify any combination of <em>selection criteria</em> to choose the files you would 
like a summary of </P>

<P>Some other points to note:
<UL>
<LI>You can add ?orderby=something arguments to the summary to change the sorting - see the urls linked via the arrows in the table headers for examples</LI>
<LI> Any file with fitsverify errors will show - fits! after the filename, this is linked to the fitsverify report. Any non engineering file with mdIngest / wmd errors will show - md! after the filename, linked to the wmdreport</LI>
<LI>Some items are abbreviated in the summary to save space. These are marked as abbreviations, so will usually render in your browser with a faint underline, and you can mouse over them to see the full text in a tooltip</LI>
<LI>If the target name has a hyperlinked star (asterisk) after it, the observation contains photometric standard stars within the field of view described by the WCS in the file. You can click on the star to see a list of the standards that are on the field</LI>
<LI>If you replace 'summary' with 'ssummary' you will get a short summary, which has a couple of columns dropped to make the table narrower to fit in a browser window better.</LI>
<LI>There is also 'lsummary' which is a long summary, with some extra columns with additional information.</LI>
<LI>You can add '/download' to the summary URL and the page will contain a [download] link after the filename that points at the fits data itself.</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>Calibration Management</H2>
<P>This system can associate certain types of calibration data with the files they are appropriate to calibrate. This can
also be used to check that suitable calibrations exist. The Calibration web interface is found under the <a href="/calibrations">/calibrations</a> URL.</P>

<P>In the calibrations system, you use the usual <em>selection criteria</em> to specify which files you would like to find
calibrations for. You can specify what type of calibrations you are interested in, for example <tt>arc</tt>.
You can also specify the type of report you would like from the calibration manager:
<UL>
<LI>requires - only list files that require the given calibration type</LI>
<LI>warnings - only list files that generate calibration warnings</LI>
<LI>missing - only list files that are missing calibrations</LI>
<LI>takenow - only list files where it would be benefficial to take a calibration today. These are where the calibration either does not exist, or it does exist but it was taken many days before or after the science data, and re-taking it now would provide a calibration that is closer in time to the science data than the existing calibrations.</LI>
</UL>

These options are simply added as extra elements of the URL like directories in a path.</P>

<P>Some examples
<UL>
<LI><a href="/calibrations/GMOS-N/today/arc/missing">/calibrations/GMOS-N/today/arc/missing</a> will list missing arc calibrations from GMOS-N data taken today</LI>
<LI><a href="/calibrations/GMOS-N/arc/missing/GN2009BC009-04">/calibrations/GMOS-N/arc/missing/GN2009BC009-04</a> will list missing arcs for GMOS-N MOS mask GN2009BC009-04. This can of course be used to check for missing calibrations before a mask is removed from the instrument. The same works for gratings too.</LI>
<LI><a href="/calibrations/GMOS-N/arc/20100301-20100331/takenow">/calibrations/GMOS-N/arc/20100301-20100331/takenow</a> will list arcs for GMOS-N data from march 2010 that it would be good to take or re-take today.</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>Selection Criteria</H2>
<P>Almost all the pages use the same selection criteria to specify the data you are interested in. 
These are inserted into the URL just like directories. You can use as many of these as you like, and the system will return
data that meets all the criteria you specify. You can put them in any order.</P>

<P>The selection criteria understood by the system are:
<UL>
<LI>A date in the form YYYYMMDD, eg 20100401. You can use today and yesterday as special literal words and they will act as you would expect.</LI>
<LI>A date range in the form YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD, eg 20100401-20100420</LI>
<LI>A telescope name, eg Gemini-North</LI>
<LI>An instrument name, eg GMOS-N. Note GMOS will also work to imply either GMOS-N or GMOS-S</LI>
<LI>AO to select only AO data, NOTAO to select only non-AO data</LI>
<LI>A program ID, eg GN-2009B-Q-51</LI>
<LI>You can also say eg progid=GN-GNIRS-Engineering to do selection on non-standard program ids</LI>
<LI>An observation ID, eg GN-2009B-Q-51-9</LI>
<LI>A data label, eg GN-2009B-Q-51-28-001</LI>
<LI>An ObsType, eg OBJECT</LI>
<LI>An ObsClass, eg science</LI>
<LI>A filename, eg N20091028S0097.fits. It works if you leave off the .fits too</LI>
<LI>A GMOS grating name, eg B600</LI>
<LI>A GMOS mask name, eg GN2009BC009-04</LI>
<LI>An NxM binning, eg 2x2. Unbinned shows as 1x1</LI>
<LI>The words <tt>low</tt>, <tt>high</tt>, <tt>fast</tt>, <tt>slow</tt> will be interpreted as gain and read speed settings. So far these only apply to GMOS</LI>

<LI>A Calibration Type, eg ARC - this is only useful with the calibration systems</LI>

<LI>A Data Reduction state - for example RAW, PREPARED, PROCESSED_BIAS, PROCESSED_FLAT</LI>
<LI>The words <tt>imaging</tt> or <tt>spectroscopy</tt> to only select imaging or spectroscopy data</LI>
<LI>A QA state - <tt>Pass</tt>, <tt>Usable</tt>, <tt>Fail</tt>, <tt>NotFail</tt> or <tt>Win</tt> - Win is taken to mean Pass or Usable (ie not Fail or Undefined), NotFail is literally every state other than Fail</LI>
<LI>The words <tt>Present</tt> or <tt>NotPresent</tt> to select only files which are or are not currently present on the storage disk.</LI>
<LI>The words <tt>canonical</tt> or <tt>notcanonical</tt>. Canonical implies the most recent version of a file.</LI>
<LI>The word <tt>photstandard</tt> to only show files that contain an observation containing a photometric standard in the Gemini list</LI>
<LI>The string <tt>filter=xxx</tt> will only include observations where the filter is xxx</LI>
<LI>The words <tt>low</tt>, <tt>high</tt>, <tt>slow</tt>, <tt>fast</tt> will be interpreted as detector configurations - ie read gain setting or read speed setting</LI>
<LI>The words <tt>Twilight</tt> or <tt>NotTwilight</tt> specify that the target name should or should not be 'Twilight'</LI>
<LI>Azimuth, Elevation, Cass Rotator PA, RA and Dec ranges can be selected. For exmple <tt>el=45.6:78.9</tt> will only select files taken at 45.6 &lt= elevation &lt 78.9. You can use 'az', 'el', 'crpa', 'ra', 'dec'. You must supply two numbers (decimal point optional and negative sign) separated by a colon. Note that it does not do intelligent range wrapping, the smaller number must be first and there's curently no way to select everything in the 20 degree range between 350 and 10 degrees. Also it takes the numbers from the header literally, in the az and crap systems these may not be limited to 0:360 or -180:180 due to the 540 degree range of these systems.</LI>

</UL></P>

<P>You can combine these arbitrarity, for example:
<UL>
<LI>20091028/NIRI will select only NIRI data from the night of 20091028</LI>
<LI>GN-2009B-Q-51/20091028 will select only GN-2009B-Q-51 data from the night of 20091028</LI>
<LI>20100123/OBJECT/science/GN2009BC009-04 will select only science (as opposed to acq) OBJECT files from 20100123 that use the GN2009BC009-04 mask</LI>
</UL>

Note that it's possible (and indeed easy) to generate selections that will return no results, for example asking for a GMOS mask with NIRI, or asking for GMOS-N files or GN programs on the Gemini South storage systems. The system does not protect
you from this, it simply returns no results.</P>

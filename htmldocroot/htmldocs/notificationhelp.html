<P>To add a new notification, enter a label for it in the field right at the bottom of the page in the "Add a new notification" section and click the save button. Then find your new (mostly blank) notification in the page you get back, and add the details for it/</P>

<H2>Notification ID: X - label</H2>
<P>The ID number is mainly for internal reference, but it's the unique identifier for this notification, so it's shown here for referene.

These hyper-links don't work if you're not on the Gemini Internal network, so you should set this to No if the recipient is an external user.</P>

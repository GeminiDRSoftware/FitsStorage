<H1>FITS Storage new data email notification list help page</H1>
<P>This is the help page for the FITS storage server <a href="/notification">new data email notification list web interface</a>.</P>

<P>The system will send out notification emails according to each notification specifier in the list. Each notification specifier details the email addresses to use and the data which should trigger the notification. The data fields are explained below.</P>

<P>To update an existing notification, enter the new details in the update fields, and click the save button.</P>

<P>To add a new notification, enter a label for it in the field right at the bottom of the page in the "Add a new notification" section and click the save button. Then find your new (mostly blank) notification in the page you get back, and add the details for it/</P>

<H2>Notification ID: X - label</H2>
<P>The ID number is mainly for internal reference, but it's the unique identifier for this notification, so it's shown here for referene. The label, after the hyphen in the title, is simply a lable or title for this notification. It's free form text, so set it to whatever you think is useful to identify or label this notification.</P>

<H2>Data Selection</H2>
<P>This is you you specify what data should trigger an email. It's the same syntax as you can use in the Fits Storage Web summary. I would imagine that in most cases for email notification, you will want to use PROJECT-ID/science - this will only trigger notifications from data with obsclass of science. If you just put the project id and leave off the /science then it will trigger if only non-science data, for example mask images or other daytime calibrations are taken.</P>
<P>There are many possibilities for advanced usage - see the "Selection Criteria" section in the <a href="/htmldocs/usage.html">Fits Storage Help Page</a> for more info. All these will work, though in general you will not want to specify a date or daterange here, as "today" is assumed for the (daily) notification emails.</P>

<H2>Email To</H2>
<P>The Email address that the notification should be sent to. You can use a comma separated list of addresses if you like.</P>

<H2>Email Cc</H2>
<P>The Email address that the notification should be CC-ed to. You can use a comma separated list of addresses if you like.</P>

<H2>Gemini Internal</H2>
<P>If the recipient is an internal Gemini staff member, you can set this to yes and the system will include hyperlinks directly to the FITS storage system web interface in the email. These hyper-links don't work if you're not on the Gemini Internal network, so you should set this to No if the recipient is an external user.</P>

<H2>Delete</H2>
<P>If you want to delete this notification, set this to yes, then hit save</P>

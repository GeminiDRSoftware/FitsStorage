<h1>Gemini Observatory Archive APIs</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>This page gives information on accessing the Gemini Observatory Archive programmatically - for example through
scripts or on the command line. There are two main aspects to this. Firstly, it is easy to construct (either 
manually or programmatically) URLs that lead to useful searches or features within the archive system. These
could return HTML that you might want to load directly into a browser for example. Secondly, you can construct
URLs that return information in JSON that you can then easily process within your own software. We discourage
processing HTML from the archive in your own software (i.e. <i>scraping</i> the HTML) - we offer no guarantee
that we will maintain the format of the HTML so your software may stop working if we change it, and generally
it's easier, more robust, and faster to use one of the JSON APIs to obtain that information.</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Basic Concepts</h2>
<p>URLs on the archive are of the form <code>https://archive.gemini.edu/<i>FEATURE</i>/<i>SELECTION</i></code> where
<i>FEATURE</i> and <i>SELECTION</i> are the archive feature you want to access, and the data selection criteria
respecively, as explained below. This applies to the human-oriented features of the archive as well as the APIs.</p>

<p>Generally you should fetch these URLs with an HTTP GET. A small number of API functions can accept an HTTP POST with
additional information for the query, this will be described for those individual cases. The archive uses 
<code>https://</code> URLS. If you try to access the archive with a <code>http://</code> URL you will receive an 
HTTP REDIRECT to the <code>https://</code> URL. It is more efficient to use <code>https://</code> directly.</p>

<h3>Archive Features</h3>
<p>You have probbaly used the regular search form for the archive, and noticed that the URL for that is
<code>https://archive.gemini.edu/<i>searchform</i></code>. "searchform" is a good example of an archive feature 
in this context, and we'll use it with a lot of our examples below. We'll discuss a complete list of features
later.<p>

<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
<p>This is a key concept of the archive system. Search terms used to select data in the archive are placed
<i>directly in the URL</i> separated by slashes, just like directories in a normal URL. Many things that you will want
to search by in the archive, such as Gemini Program IDs or UT dates have a prescribed standard format, and the
archive will recognise these automatically for what they are. For example 8 digit numbers that refer to valid
dates such as <code>20140410</code> will be recognised automatically as a UT date, and strings such as GN-2010B-Q-123 will
be recognized automatically as Gemini Program IDs.</p>
<p>So, using these examples, using <code>GN-2010B-Q-123</code> as the selection would select data from that program ID, and
using <code>GN-2010B-Q-123/20140410</code> would select data from that program ID that was taken on that UT date.
It does not matter what order you specify these in.</p>
<p>In this way, we can build up URLs that refer to the search or search results of various searches on the archive. All
these should be accessed with regular HTTP GET, there's no need to HTTP POST search parameters to the system, we provide 
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> interface to the data.</p>

<p>If you add /object=foobar to the URL (it's a selection criteria just like the others) then it will only return files with 
that object name. The problem is that the object name in that sense is whatever they called it in the OT, and it's free 
form, so if they want to call it pauls_kewl_galaxy or candidate_12 they can do, and they do... So if you did the phase 2 and 
you know what you called it, then it works great, or if you're lucky and your object only has one name that can be spelled 
one way...</p>

<p>But what you almost certainly really want to do is to resolve the name and search by ra and dec. The API doesn't do that 
directly. When you do this in the web searchform, it's basically the searchform that's doing that for you, not the backend 
search engine. So if you resolve the name yourself (or call some service to do that), you can then search by ra and dec in 
decimal degrees as simply as,</p>

<pre>
/ra=40.6698792/dec=-0.0132889.
</pre>

<p>This will default to a 3 arcmin radius cone search. You can specify the cone search radius by adding /sr=10 (units are 
arcsec)</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Here is a list of the available features on the system:</p>

<h3>searchform</h3>
<p>The regular search form for the archive. When you pass a selection criteria to the search form it will pre-populate
the fields of the form with the selection criteria you have passed, and will execute that search. This is how it works
when you do a search and then bookmark the resulting web page or copy the URL for future use etc - when you do the search, 
it simply places the search terms from the form into the URL and redirects your browser to that URL. If you re-visit this
URL later, it will re-do the search and return you the filled out search form with the results. You can then of course 
modify the fields in the form and search again if you wish.</p>

<h3>summary</h3>
<p>This works a lot like searchform, except it just sends you the simple results table. You don't get the search form itself,
nor do you get the tabs to see associated calibrations or observation logs, you simply get the main search results table showing
the results of the search as specified by the selection criteria you specified in the URL. You can also use <kbd>ssummary</kbd> 
(short summary) and <kbd>lsummary</kbd> (long summary) to get versions with fewer and more columns respectively.</p>

<h3>jsonfilelist</h3>
<p>This returns you a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> representation of the files in the archive that
match your selection criteria. You should almost always include /canonical as one of your selection criteria (see note below). 
The JSON returned contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes a file
in the archive. The keys in the dictionary and their meanings are as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Key</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>The name of the dataset. This does not include the .bz2 if the file is compressed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>filename</td>
<td>the filename of the file. Most of the files in the archive are bzip2 compressed, so this will likely end in .bz2</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>compressed</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>file_md5</td>
<td>the MD5 hash of the file as stored in the archive, in hexdigest format</td>
</tr><tr>

If the file is not compressed this will be the same as file_md5</td>
</tr><tr>

<td>the same as file_md5. Deprecated</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>jsonsummary</h3>
<p>This returns you a JSON representation of your search results that includes all the information (and more) that you get on the summary and 
searchform results tables. You should almost always include /canonical as one of your selection criteria (see note below). 
As with jsonfilelist, you get a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per file. You get all the keys from jsonfilelist
plus a lot more that contain details of the data, as follows:</p>

<h2 id="downloading">Downloading Data</h2>
<p>Two URLs are available to download data from the archive.</p>

<p>Firstly, the <code>/download</code> URL uses the same selection criteria as detailed above, and will return a tar 
archive containing the data that match the selection. The files inside the tar archive will be compressed with bzip2. 
Also inside the tar archive is a <code>README.txt</code> file with some details of the download, and an 
<code>md5sums.txt</code> file that contains the MD5 hash of each file in the download, so that file integrity can 
easily be checked using the <code>md5sum</code> program installed on most UNIX-like systems.</p>

<p>Secondly, the <code>/file</code> URL accepts a single filename and will return you just that file, uncompressed
and ready to use.</p>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p>Note that these URLs will provide public data without any need to authenticate. However, they do require
authentication in order to download proprietary data. In the case where you do not authenticate, the 
<code>/download</code> URL will send you any public files that match your selection criteria, and will include
in the README.txt file a list of files to which you were denied access.</p>

<p>To authenticate to these services, you need to supply your archive session cookie.
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">web cookie</a> is a small piece of data sent from a web
server to your browser that your browser stores and presents back to the web server. 
When you log in to your account on the archive, the server sends you a cookie called
<code>gemini_archive_session</code>. The value of this cookie identifies you to the system and verifies that
you have sucessfully logged in. In order to authenticate yourself to the download service, you need to send the
same cookie to the server with your request. If you want to do this from a script or the command line you will
first have to find the value of that cookie from your browser, and then include it in your download request headers.</p>

<p>Finding the value of the cookie depends on your browser. In Firefox, navigate to any archive page, then go to 
Tools - Page Info, then inside Security there is a View Cookies button. In Safari first go to Preferences - Advanced
and turn on "Show Develop menu" then navigate to an archive page and in the Develop menu click "Show Web Inspector" then
select Cookies in the Resources tab. The cookie you need is called <code>gemini_archive_session</code>.</p>

<p>The value of the cookie you need will be a long apparently random string of characters. You should be able to copy
/ paste it into to your script. Be sure to keep that cookie value confidential, anyone who has it can access your archive account. If
you need to reset it (for example because it became known to someone else), then simply use a web browser to
<strong>Log Out</strong> of the archive and the old value will no longer be accepted by the server. When you log back
in to the archive, a new value will be sent to the browser where you logged in.</p>

<h2 id="selection">Selection Criteria</h2>

<p>Here are details of the selection criteria you can use. Multiple ones are separated by /s in the URL just like directories would be.</p>

<p>The <code>present</code> and <code>canonical</code> selection criteria are worth of special explanation. When the archive ingests
a new data file, that file is marked as both present (physically present in the file store) and canonical (it is the canonical version
of that file). If the file is modified at Gemini (for example the QA state is updated) and it is re-ingested into the archive, the archive
adds a new database record for the updated file but the entry for the old file is not deleted, it is simply marked as not present and 
not canonical. This means that the archive has some history information of previous file versions. We use two separate flags for these
because we use the same software for internal data management, where old files may be scrubbed off disk to free up space for new ones - in
which case the database record will reflect that file version can be canonical but no longer present on disk.</p>

<p>The search form and data summaries assume <strong>canonical</strong> as one of the search criteria as you are almost always looking
for the most recent (canonical) version of the file. The JSON APIs do not do this so as to allow you to deliberately look for information on 
previous versions of the file. Assuming you don't want to do that, <strong>you should always have /canonical as one your selection
criteria with the JSON APIs</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sample_code">Sample python code</h2>
<h3>Simple file list using jsonfilelist</h3>
<p>This is a simple example in python that constructs a jsonfilelist URL, fetches the JSON document text into a string,
parses that into a list of dictionaries, and then loops through showing some details of the files we found.</p>
<div class="sample"><pre><code>
import urllib
import json

# Construct the URL. We'll use the jsonfilelist service
url = "https://archive.gemini.edu/jsonfilelist/"

# List the files for GN-2010B-Q-22 taken with GMOS-N on 2010-12-31
url += "canonical/GN-2010B-Q-22/GMOS-N/20101231"

# Open the URL and fetch the JSON document text into a string
u = urllib.urlopen(url)
jsondoc = u.read()
u.close()

# Decode the JSON
files = json.loads(jsondoc)

# This is a list of dictionaries each containing info about a file
for f in files:
    print "Filename: %s" % f['filename']
    print "-- file size: %d, data size: %d" % (f['file_size'], f['data_size'])

</code></pre></div>

<p>Gives the following output:</p>
<div class="sample"><pre><code>
Filename: N20101231S0338.fits.bz2
-- file size: 21314852, data size: 57548160

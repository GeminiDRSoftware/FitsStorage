<h1>About the Gemini Observatory Archive</h1>

<p>The Gemini Observatory Archive was built at Gemini Observatory in 2014 and 2015 
as a lower cost replacement for the Gemini Science Archive which was operated under contract.</p>

<p>The software was developed in house based on the FitsStorage software which had been developed
previously as an internal data management tool. It makes heavy use of the AstroData module from the
Gemini Python software written by the Gemini Data Processing Software Group.</p>

<p>Paul Hirst is the project manager and primary developer and developed the original FitsStorage
software. Ricardo Cardenes is a software developer on the project. University of Victoria students 
Adam Paul and Petra Clementson worked on the project during their internships Gemini.</p>

<h1>About the Gemini Observatory Archive</h1>

<p>The Gemini Observatory Archive was built at Gemini Observatory in 2014 and 2015 
as a lower cost replacement for the Gemini Science Archive which was operated under contract.</p>

<p>The software was developed in house based on the FitsStorage software which had been developed
previously as an internal data management tool. It makes heavy use of the AstroData module from the
DRAGONS software written by the Gemini Science User Support Department.</p>

<p>Paul Hirst is the project manager and primary developer and developed the original FitsStorage
software. Ricardo Cardenes was a software developer on the project. University of Victoria students
Adam Paul and Petra Clementson worked on the project during their internships at Gemini.
Maintenance and development are now handled by Oliver Oberdorf.</p>

<h1>Current Status</h1>

<p>This system is fully operational.</p>
<p>Raw data is being automatically ingested in near-real-time from both telescopes.</p>
<p> We are not aware of any major issues with the system, if you find a problem that is not
    listed below, please do report it in the

   <P>Welcome, you are successfully logged in to the Gemini Archive.</P>

   <P>There are now several options for logging in to the Gemini Observatory Archive -
     the "traditional" GOA username and password options still works, but you can
     now also authenticate using your ORCID ID, and NOIRlab staff can authenticate using
     NOIRlab single sign on.</P>
   <P>Whichever method you use to log in, you <em>should</em> end up logged in to the
     same GOA account. Please try to avoid ending up with different accounts for different
     sign-on methods, as things like proprietary program access will then be inconsistent
     between your accounts. The key here is the email address associated with your various sign-ons.</P>
   <P> If for example you already have a traditional GOA username and password, and you would
     like so switch to signing in with your ORCID, please ensure that the email address
     you have registered to your GOA account matches the one you have registered to your
     ORCID account. You can update the email address on your GOA account
     <a href="/change_email">here</a>".</P>
   <P>NORlab staff users - everything above regarding ORCID sign-in also applies to
     NOIRLab SSO sign in. Please also note that gemini.edu and noirlab.edu email addresses
     are not considered to be the same in this case.</P>

<H2>Click here to sign in using ORCID</H2>

<H2>Not sure which to use?</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>If you are a Gemini User (i.e. research astronomer or other community member
accessing Gemini data), we recommend using ORCID. This applies even if you are also NOIRlab staff.
  <UL>
    <LI>If you don't already have an ORCID ID, sign up for one <a href="https://orcid.org/register">here.</a></LI>
    <LI>If you already have a GOA account, but it uses a different email address to your
    ORCID, please go <a href="/change_email"> here </a> to update your GOA email to match
    your ORCID email before signing in with ORCID.</LI>
    <LI>If you don't already have a GOA account, just sign in using ORCID, we'll set one up
    for you automatically as sign in.</LI>
  </UL></LI>
  <LI>If you are NOIRlab staff member, do not have an ORCID, and are accessing GOA
    for operational duties, use the NOIRlab SSO sign in.
    <UL>
      <LI>If you don't already have an account, we'll create one automatically for as you sign in.</LI>
      <LI>If you need staff data access privelidges, you will need to request that separately after you have signed.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
  <LI>If you are not a NOIRlab staff member, don't want to create or use an ORCID, or just prefer the simple old ways,
    sign in using the traditional username / password form. If you don't already have an account, you can
    <a href="/request_account">request one here</a></LI>
  <LI>If you think you've ended up with multiple accounts, please either file a helpdesk
  ticket, or contact Paul Hirst, and it should be simple for us to merge your accounts into one.</LI>

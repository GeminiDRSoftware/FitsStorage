Database schema changes:
-- add wmd to diskfiles table
-- add exposure time and filter to headers table and to summary report
**** Add task to summary generator or whatever when these are done

Apachehandler:

create fits file server

Summary Generator:
create a diskfile summary

Logistics:
get fits dns CNAME
create virtual servers for fits and hbffits1
comment, document and mark authorship on code

write ingest and update scripts to support NFS operation - eg update data from today only to run every rew mins etc


low priority:
investigate parsing eObslog to get comments.
any way to get pre-imaging flag from odb? anything else we need? requestd conditions
completely customisable columns in summary.

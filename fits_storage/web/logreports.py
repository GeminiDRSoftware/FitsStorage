    # Subquery that summarizes uploads and bytes. The rationale for this subquery would be the same as
    # for download_query, as the relationship between usagelog and fileuploadlog is technically a
    # one-to-many. In reality, though, the current implementation accepts only single files per upload,
    # so there's only one entry per upload. It doesn't hurt to generalize, though, and gives us an
    # appropriate target for the big fat JOIN that will be performed later. Plus, if we ever implement
    # uploading tarballs, we get that for free (aren't we smart?)
    #
    # This is basically equivalent to:
    #
    #   (
    #    SELECT   ul.id AS ulid, COUNT(1) as `count`, SUM(ful.bytes) AS bytes
    #    FROM     fileuploadlog AS ful JOIN usagelog AS ul ON ful.usagelog_id = ul.id
    #    GROUP BY ul.id
    #   ) AS upload_stats
    #
    # The name for the fields are equivalent to those of the download query; just substitute
    # 'downloaded' for 'uploaded'.
    upload_query = session.query(UsageLog.id.label('ulid'),
                                 func.count(FileUploadLog.id).label('count'),
                                 func.sum(FileUploadLog.size).label('bytes'))\
                          .select_from(join(FileUploadLog, UsageLog))\

                          .cte(name='upload_stats')

    # Now, THIS unassuming query fragment is the core join that relates all the usage statistics.
    # It's equivalent to:
    #
    #    ...
    #    FROM (usagelog AS ul LEFT JOIN download_stats AS ds ON ul.id = ds.ulid)
    #                         LEFT JOIN upload_stats AS us ON ul.id = us.ulid
    #    ...
    #
    # Notice that we're doing Left Outer Joins here. This is VERY IMPORTANT. Doing a regular
    # Inner (natural) Join would return rows ONLY where a usagelog entry has a corresponding
    # download entry (or entries)... AND a corresponding upload entry.
    #
    # Which is impossible
    #
    # It would be bad enough even if we had only downloads, because we'de be limited to only
    # download queries, and we want all of them. In any case, what we get out of this join
    # operation is one row per usagelog entry, with (potentally) extra data if there was a
    # download or an upload. Otherwise, all those extra columns will be NULL, which is OK.
    the_join = join(join(UsageLog, download_query, UsageLog.id == download_query.c.ulid,
                         isouter=True),
                    upload_query, UsageLog.id == upload_query.c.ulid,
                    isouter=True)

    # Now comes the (potentially) most confusing part. We want to group the entries of the
    # join we just defined. And the grouping will be done according to one out of three
    # criteria:
    #
    #  - per year
    #  - per week (with the first day of the first week starting in the day passed in 'since',
    #              may not necessarily be Sunday - or Monday, for those of you in countries with
    #              a non-Sunday first day of the week)
    #  - per day
    #
    # To do this, in the following piece of code we create a master query that incorporates
    # the_join. Notice, though, that we're only querying for one column (the one that defines
    # the period for the row). That's OK. All the other columns are common to the different
    # queries, and we'll add them later using the `add_columns` method of the SQLAlchemy
    # query object.
    if period == 'year':
        # Simple enough. We extract the year component out of the usagelog.utdatetime, and
        # use that information to group the rows. Nothing complicated here.
        #
        # The equivalent query here would be then:
        #
        #    SELECT   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM utdatetime)
        #    FROM     (usagelog AS ul LEFT JOIN download_stats AS ds ON ul.id = ds.ulid)
        #                            LEFT JOIN upload_stats AS us ON ul.id = us.ulid)
        #    ORDER BY 1  -- Using the column position to avoid repeating the whole
        #    GROUP BY 1  -- EXTRACT(....)
        #
        ULYEAR = extract('YEAR', UsageLog.utdatetime)
        query = session.query(to_int(ULYEAR)).select_from(the_join).order_by(ULYEAR).group_by(ULYEAR)
    elif period in ('week', 'day'):
        # These two are a bit more complicated. It's easy to group by year, because it's
        # the slowest changing member of the date component... and never repeats (within
        # a specified calendar convention, that is)
        #
        # Week and day numbers, though, repeat rather often, meaning that we CANNOT use
        # them straight. Instead, we'll define an auxiliary 'period' table, with entries
        # defining the beginning and end of one. That will let us use the 'BETWEEN' operator
        # as grouping criterion.

        since = cast(since, Date) # Just to make sure that we have a date, not a timestamp

        # oneinterval is the only variable thing here. It depends on the input arguments
        # and can be one of:
        #
        #   - INTERVAL '1 week'
        #   - INTERVAL '1 day'
        oneinterval = cast('1 {0}'.format(period), Interval)
        onemsecond = cast('1 microsecond', Interval)

        # The following describes an aliased table (in SQLAlchemy terminology; for
        # PostgreSQL we would be talking about a CTE - Common Table Expression).
        # Also known as 'WITH query' Very useful to break down complicated queries
        # into simple ones.
        #
        # This one will prepare a temporary table of periods for us:
        #
        #    SELECT generate_series(first_date, last_date, INTERVAL '...') as start
        #
        # `start` is the name of the column in this subquery. `timeperiod` (the name
        # of the "aliased" table) will be used in the final query.
        intervals = func.generate_series(since, func.now(), oneinterval).label('start')
        aliased_intervals = aliased(session.query(intervals).subquery(), 'timeperiod')

        # Here we define the starting and ending points of a period. `start` comes
        # from the `start` column from timeperiod.
        # `end` is equivalent to (start + INTERVAL '...' - INTERVAL '1 microsecond').
        # We substract one microsecond because the operator 'BETWEEN' works on
        # closed ranges, meaning that it will include both ends. Substracting that
        # microsecond will get us a period like:
        #
        #  2015-02-14 00:00:00 - 2015-02-20 23:59:59.999999
        #
        # which should be more than enough precision for our needs. This won't work
        # if a query was placed during a leap second, but tough luck...
        start = aliased_intervals.c.start
        end = (start + oneinterval) - onemsecond

        # One more LEFT join! This one is to incorporate the whole list of periods
        # to the query. Again, we use a LEFT join to allow the retrieval of periods
        # with no activity whatsoever (an inner join would skip them). Equivalent to:
        #
        #   ... FROM timeperiod AS tp LEFT JOIN the_main_join AS tmj ON ul.utdatetime BETWEEN start AND end ...
        #
        # Here `ul` comes from the core JOIN that we defined befure, and `start` and `end`
        # are the expressions we just defined.

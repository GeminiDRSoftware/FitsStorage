1) Is RAWGEMQA defined and different of 'UNKNOWN'?
2) Are RAWIQ, RAWCC, RAWWV, RAWBG defined and different of 'UNKNOWN'?
4) EQUINOX/EPOCH are floating point (Standard) vs something else
5) If RELEASE is there give points
n) Are there missing headers in one of the files?

Think about the following:

 * Give extra points to the most recent RELEASE
 * If IRAF-TLM is there, give points
   - If IRAF-TLM is in more than one file, then the more recent
     one(s) should get extra points

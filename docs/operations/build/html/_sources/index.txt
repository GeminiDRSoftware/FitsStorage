FitsStorage operations guide
============================

This document is not intended as a complete reference to the FitsStorage system, rather it is intended as a guide to
how it is deployed operationally at Gemini, both in the summit Fits Servers and in the Gemini Observatory Archive.
This document should allow anyone with suitable access and basic unix / linux knowledge to troubleshoot and fix
operational issues with these systems.

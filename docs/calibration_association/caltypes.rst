Calibration Types
=================

Various types of calibrations have historically been referred to with different
names both in Gemini data reduction software, but especially in Gemini
operations and observation definition. In the latter case, names tended to
describe more how the calibration data is taken, without reference to how it
would be used in the data processing. For example "twilights" commonly
refered to imaging twilight flat field, but "spectwilights", which are taken
in a similar manner but in a spectroscopy configuration are actually used for
slit function calibration rather than flat fielding. Some calibration types are
referred to with different names in different contexts. This documentation
serves to clarify the preferred calibration type name to use and function of
the different calibration types supported.

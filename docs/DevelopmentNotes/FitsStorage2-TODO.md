## TODO list for FitsStorage2 being ready for operational use

Note, nice-to-haves and enhancements should be filed as issues on github
and tagged as enhancement. This list is for stuff that *needs* to be done
in order to get the new code base into production use. It's divided into two
lists, one for the summit fits servers, the other for the archive. Oh, and
another one for the tape server

### Summit Fits Servers

* Visitor instrument data header fixing and ingest
* FITS header update interface that the SOSs use (was api, now fileops)
* Re-implement a queue status display
* Fix previews


### Archive



### Tape Server

* Test and convert the whole tape system I guess.

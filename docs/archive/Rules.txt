DESCRIPTION OF THE RULE FILE SYNTAX AND FUNCTIONALITY
=====================================================

The image-validation rule system for the Gemini Archive has been developed
following CADC's use of a hierarchical definition for their data dictionary.
This may not be the best idea and is open to change, but any system that
would replace the current one should provide at least the same functionality.

Our current system is based on "rule files". Each rule file is composed of
a number of sections, all of them optional - but at least one of them must
be present. We'll refer to the sections by the name that is used in the files
to define them and, while they can appear in any order in the files, you'll
usually find them in the following order.

   * provides
   * includes
   * conditions
   * range limits
   * keywords
   * tests

They're used in a very specific order, though:

1. ``conditions`` is used to determine if a rules file will be used. If it doesn't,
   the rest are not taken into account.
2. ``includes`` is read and all the included ruleset files are queued to be checked
   later.
3. ``keywords`` checks are performed.
4. ``tests`` checks are performed.
5. ``provides`` is applied, as long as 2 & 3 passed.

Notice the absence of ``range limits``. That one is not used explicitly, but affects
the checks listed under ``keywords``.

Here's a real example file showing examples of most of the sections. Please,
use it as refernce of real usage for the concepts we'll be discussing in the
rest of the document.

        # Checks GEMPRGID, OBSID, AND DATALAB
          - valid-observation-info
          - wcs-after-pdu

The meaning and use of those sections will be presented later in this
document.

Being hierarchical in nature, this system organizes the rules that an image
must comply to in "levels" (each file represents a level), from the more
abstract (eg. *is it a Gemini-produced image?*, *is it an engineering image?*)
to more concrete (eg. *is this the blue-arm extension for a NICI image?*)
Every HDU of an image MUST pass all the applicable levels to mark that image
as "correct".

Also, note that each HDU of an image is processed in the same order that they
found in the file, and they're considered separately from the others. This is
a limitation of the system (an image is not considered as a whole). We may
need some information from the Primary HDU to properly test the extensions,
though; we need a mechanism to pass this information along: the context.

We'll introduce all those concepts now. By the end of the document you'll be
presented with an example test that explains how the system uses all the
information to decide on the validity of a FITS file.

Test Context
------------

The testing framework creates a 'context' for each tested image. This context
is just a container for words, like 'facility', 'wcs-in-hdu', etc. that are
added either implicitly by the framework itself or by test functions, or
explicitly by passed rule files. Those words can be looked up later and used
as part of the tests.

As mentioned before, this is the way to pass information across HDU tests.
We'll see more in a moment.

All the words added by users writing new rule files are arbitrary and can
be used as they please, except for ``valid``, which has a meaning for the
system. In practice, the only rule files that add ``valid`` to the context
are the ones under the ``pdu`` and ``ext`` directories, which define the
peculiarities of each instrument's headers.

General Syntax
--------------

The files are all valid [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) documents.
YAML provides a simple syntax to describe structured data (lists and attribute
dictionaries) which can be presented in two different ways: inline or block
format. Please, read YAML's documentation to learn this more in detail, if
you want, but in principle, the only thing we need to learn is how to write
lists of values, which can be done like this:

::

        # List in inline mode
        [ gmos, gnirs, nifs ]
        
        # Same list in block mode
        - gmos
        - gnirs
        - nifs

You'll see lists all over the place in the existing documents.

# TODO: Explain lists associated to attributes

YAML allows our software to recognize automatically numbers, strings of
characters, etc., but also special elements, like null and boolean
(true/false) values, which can make writing the documents a bit tricky. In
principle, this only means that whenever you need to write **yes**, **true**,
**no**, or **false** (capitalized or not), you **must** put that word in
single quotes (eg. ``'Yes'``). The example document shows a case where this
was needed.

The 'provides' section
----------------------

This is the simplest of all sections: it represents a list of words to be
added to the working environment. These words are not added unconditionally,
though: the rules listed in the other sections have to pass, first.

Examples:

::

        # Taken from pdu/gmos.def
        provides:        [ valid, gmos ]
        
        # Taken from ext/nifs.def
        provides:          valid

Currently, there are only two uses for the ``provides`` section:

    - To declare that passing the tests of the current rule file is
      *necessary condition* to make an HUD a valid one. **All** tested
      HDUs must incorporate ``valid`` to the context at some point;
      otherwise, it will NOT be considered a valid HDU, no matter how
      many tests it passes.
    - To introduce words that can be used for the processing of further
      HDUs. Right now we only use it to mark a FITS file as belonging to
      a certain instrument. As we can only identify the instrument through
      the PHDU, we will need such a mark when testing extension HDUs. In the
      example, we're marking the FITS file as belonging to ``gmos``.

The testing engine introduces a number of words in the context before starting
to process the rule files, or through the use of test functions:

``facility``
    This image belongs to a facility instrument

``prepared``
    This is not a raw image, but a preprocessed file. This will be used, for
    example, to disable testing for WCS

``date:XXXX-YY-ZZ``
    Used by the engine to determine if certain rules apply or not. This is important
    because the contents of some instrument FITS headers have evolved over the years

The ``includes`` section
------------------------

In the introduction we established that the rule file system is hierarchical. We use
the ``includes`` section to point to the The
following image shows part of the hierarchy at the time of writing this document.

.. image:: file:graph.svg

As we can see, on the top we have ``fits``, which is a dummy file meant only to have a
top for the hierarchy. It looks like this:

::

        # This file is the root of the definition tree

        include files: gemini

The ``gemini`` file, in turn, introduces some initial conditions for image validity,
and includes more files:

::

        conditions:
          - is-gemini-data
          - not failed-data
          - not engineering
        
        include files: [ fphdu, vphdu, extensions ]

Notice that some files are meant to be included by more than one other (eg. ``wcs`` or
``radec``), as they provide tests shared across various instruments. Even if a file is
included more than once at different levels of the structure, it will be tested only once
per HDU (if applicable).

Every time a file is included, it is tested for *applicability*: ie., if conditions are
met to use it as a validity test. If it is **not** applicable, then the files included
in that rule file won't be taken into account.

The ``conditions`` section
--------------------------

The testing engine reads all the rule files before it starts testing an image,
but not all rule files apply to all images, or even to all headers within an
image. Eg., facility instruments images need to adhere to more strict rules
than those created using visitor instruments; a GSAOI file would never pass
the rules written for MICHELLE; and an Primary HDU includes certain information
that won't be found in an Extension HDU; etc.

For this reason, we may write a ``conditions`` section in a rule file. Before
considering the rule file, the testing engine will check all the "conditions"
that we list in there against the current HDU. If any of them fails, the rule
file will not be considered; otherwise, it will be used included in the
restrictions to be met by the HDU.

Example:

::

        # Taken from fphdu.def
        conditions:
          - is facility
          - not exists:
            - XTENSION
          - set-date
          - matching:
            - TELESCOP: [ Gemini-South, Gemini-North ]

The following tests can be specified for ``conditions``. Most of them can be
specified in an "affirmative" and a "negative" way. Explanations for both
are given:

``is [not] <word>``
    Passes if ``<word>`` exists in the context. If used as ``is not``, then
    ``<word>`` must be absent from the context.

``[not] exists``
    Takes a list of KEYWORDs. All the listed keywords have to exist in the
    HDU header. If used as ``not exists``, then **none** of the keywords may
    exist in the the header.

``[not] matching``
    Takes a list of pairs ``KEYWORD: value`` (where ``value`` may be a list of
    values). For every listed keyword, it has to be found in the HDU header
    and its value must be the specified one (or one of them, if a list is
    provided).

    If used as ``not matching``, then they keyword *may not* match any of the
    specified values, if it exists in the header.

``[not] <function-name>``
    There are number of pre-defined functions, for tasks more complicated than
    just matching keywords. Some of them are used to place values in the
    context, while others will perform complex tests that are not possible using
    the regular syntax that we provide.
    The logic is simple: the test will pass if the function returns a positive
    result (or a negative one, if used as ``[not] <function-name>``
    There's a list of functions at the end of this document.

The ``keywords`` section
------------------------

This section describes a list of keywords that **should exist** in the HDU
header, and optionally meet certain requirements. Notice that there are similar tests
in the ``conditions`` section. There's a difference, though: ``conditions`` is used just
to decide if a rules file is accepted or ignored, for testing purposes. By the time
we get to ``keywords``, though, the rules file has been accepted: failing any of the
tests in this section will tag the FITS file as invalid.

An example:

::

        # Taken from pdu/gmos.def
        keywords:
          - DARKTIME,EXPTIME:
            - float:      0 .. *
        
          - MASKID:
            - int
          - MASKNAME:
            - char
          - MASKTYP,MASKLOC:
            - int:      [ -1, 0, 1 ]
        
          - FILTER1,FILTER2:
            - char:      not null
          - FILTID1,FILTID2:
            - int
        
          - GRATING:
            - char:      not null
          - GRATID:
            - int
        
          - FRAME
          - TIME-OBS
          - UTSTART

We see keywords that are listed just to make sure they exist (like ``FRAME`` or ``UTSTART``).
Then we have keywords like ``GRATING`` or ``MASKID`` that not only have to exist, but they
also need to meet certain requirements, like containing a value of a certain type, or
within certain range. Keywords specifying requirements must end in a colon (``:``). Keyword
names **must** be specified in capital letters.

As you can see in the example, more than one keyword can be specified in a row (separated
with commas). This syntax is used when related keywords share common requirements, to avoid
repeating them all over the file. Here's another example of this being useful, taken from
the GMOS PDU definition:

::

          - CCDSIZE,CCDSEC,DATASEC,DETSEC,BIASSEC:
            - pattern:    '\[\d+:\d+,\d+:\d+]'

More than one restriction can be specified, even if they are mutually exclusive (eg.
specifying two different types for a keyword). In the case where two mutually exclusive
requirements are specified for a keyword, only one of them must be met -of course.
Examples of these are:

::

        # From pdu/niri.def
          - FILTER1,FILTER2,FILTER3:
            - char:     [ 'open', 'blank' ]
            - pattern:  '.*_G\d{4}'
        
        # From pdu/nifs.def
          - GRATING:
            - pattern:    '.*_G\d{4}'
            - pattern:    '[HJK]\d{3}'

In the case of NIRI, we've defined three keywords (``FILTERn``) to be either a character
string with values that must be **exactly** ``open`` or ``blank``, or a character with a
pattern matching ``.*_G\d{4}`` (ie. anything followed by ``_G`` and then exactly 4 digits).
For the NIFS example, we see a ``GRATING`` keyword which accepts two different patterns.

Controlling which keywords are mandatory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The keywords that are not listed in a rule file are completely ignored and, **by default**,
any listed keywords will be considered mandatory. There are cases, though, where a keyword
may not apply in all cases. We provide two ways to control this:

The ``optional`` modifier
    It is used mostly for non-facility instruments. In those cases, we may want to ignore a
    certain keyword if it's not there but, if it exists, then we want to make sure that it
    meets some requirements. That's what ``optional`` gets us.

The ``if [not] <word>`` modifier
    This modifier controls wether a keyword is mandatory or not by checking if a certain
    `<word>` is present (or not) in the environment. An example of this would be checking
    for keywords will be present in raw images, but not in preprocessed ones, like:

::

          - if not prepared:
            - GAIN:
              - float
            - RDNOISE:
              - float
            - CCDSUM:
              - char:     [ '1 1', '1 2', '1 4', '2 1', '2 2', '2 4', '4 1', '4 2', '4 4' ]
            - CCDNAME:
              - char:       not null
            - CCDSIZE,CCDSEC,DATASEC,DETSEC,BIASSEC:
              - pattern:    '\[\d+:\d+,\d+:\d+]'


The ``since YYYY-MM-DD`` modifier
    Instrument headers tend to change with time. This happens during development of the
    instrument, or when there's a change in the Observatory standards. It may be the case
    that a certain keyword appears in the header only after a certain date, and making it
    mandatory all the time would give us bogus results for old images.

    This is why we provide the ``since`` modifier. A keyword modified by it is mandatory
    from the point in time determined by the provided date, but completely ignored before
    that.

    The date used to compare against this is inferred from the context.

The ``until YYYY-MM-DD`` modifier
    Same rationale as with ``since``, but meaning that the keyword is considered mandatory
    only until the date we indicate.

All the modifiers that we have introduced here can be used at the same time. Just make sure
that they don't cause conflict with each other. They also admit two different uses: directly
as a modifier of a particular keyword:

::

          - RADECSYS:
            - since 2006-7-1

or grouping a number of keywords, like in the example shown for ``if word``.

List of requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the complete list of requirements that can be specified for a keyword:

``<type>``
    This would be one of ``char``, ``float``, ``int``, ``bool``, ``date``

``<type>: <range>``
    Same as with ``<type>``, but adding a range of acceptable values. The way a range
    can be specified may depend on the type:

- For all types, a single value or a list of them can be specified. Examples are::

        - char:     [ In, Out ]
        - int:      [ -1, 0, 1 ]

- For numeric values and dates, a range can be specified like this::

            start .. end

  where either ``start`` *or* ``end`` may be an asterisk (`*`), meaning that the
  range is open ended on that side. For example::

        - DATEIMAG:     2006-7-1 .. *

- Also, a particular value for ``char`` that makes sure there's some non-null value
  assigned to the keyword::

        - char:         not null

``upper: <range>``
    Similar to a ``char: <range>``, but the content of the keyword is converted to
    uppercase before comparing it with the ``range``. For example::

        - upper:        UNKNOWN

    would accept keywords with a value of ``Unknown``, ``unknown``, ``UNKNOWN``, etc.

``lower: <range>``
   Same as with ``upper``, but having the content converted to lowercase before
   comparing. Typically using one or the other is a matter of preference.

``pattern: '<regular expression>'``
   Accepts as argument a (single) quoted string that is a valid `Python regex <http://https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html>`.
   The value associated to the keyword will be matched against the pattern.

The ``tests`` section
---------------------

``tests`` is applied after ``keywords`` has passed. This means that by the time the
``tests`` are evaluated, we know that all the required keywords exist and have the
right value.

The ``tests`` section is used to perform complex checks that would require proper
algorithmic syntax. Instead of that, we provide such checks in the form of functions.
Refer to the example rule file at the beginning of this document to see it in use.

The syntax for this section is identical to the one of ``conditions``. On the other
hand, where failing checks on ``conditions`` would simply discard a rule file,
failing a check in the ``tests`` section renders a header invalid.

PH TODO list 2023

* Major cleanup of aws_s3 module. Looks like boto3 now offers some higher
level interfaces that we can use rather than doing things like multipart
handling ourselves.

* Provenance and ProvenanceHistory support. in core.ingest.py we skip it.
Code review of core.orm.provenance.py and parts of diskfie.py needed.

* All exception handlers should just say:
logger.error("Exception happened", exc_info=True)
and the logger will pretty-print the exc_info for you!
This works for error and debug.

PH TODO list 2023

* Major cleanup of aws_s3 module. Looks like boto3 now offers some higher
level interfaces that we can use rather than doing things like multipart
handling ourselves.

* Provenance and ProvenanceHistory support. in core.ingester.py we skip it.
Code review of core.orm.provenance.py and parts of diskfie.py needed.

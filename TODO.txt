PH TODO list 2023

* Major cleanup of aws_s3 module. Looks like boto3 now offers some higher
level interfaces that we can use rather than doing things like multipart
handling ourselves.

* Provenance and ProvenanceHistory support. in core.ingester.py we skip it.
Code review of core.orm.provenance.py and parts of diskfie.py needed.

* Reenable commented provenance line in summary_generator.py after we sort
out provenance in diskfile. Does this actually do anything?

* previews and spectrum previews.

* re enable previews in summary_generator.py after sorting them out upstream.

* Once we're switched over to nginx, make it accept http keep-alive. In
the export system, use requests sessions (see hacks on cpofits-lv3). This
should apply to things like the jsonsummary etc calls that the export system
makes too. Also apply same in delete files and other cases where we hit the
api from a client.

* server/access_control_utils.py has got convoluted and messy. Needs some
refresh. Suggest add a is_released property to the orm classes for header,
miscfile and obslog (the latter will handle the necessary queries). Also
suggest move the log handling back to the callers, it might save a few lines
of code putting it here, but it makes it more convoluted and less explicit.

* /curation should require being logged in at least, preferably as admin
or superuser as it can be database intensive. Review URL list for similar
urls that should not be public.
